## What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as code (IaC) are ability to provision and managing of infrastructure through a code instead of manual process. Manual infrastructure management is time-consuming and prone to errorâ€”especially when you manage applications at scale. Infrastructure as code lets you define your infrastructure's desired state without including all the steps to get to that state.

## Repository Structure

- `terraform/` - What is Terraform, some hands-on practice using Terraform.
- `cloudformation/` - What is CloudFormation, hands-on practice using CloudFormation.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document my hands-on learning process, keep track of scripts, configurations, and insights gained while practicing Infrastructure as Code.

## How to Use This Repo?

1. Explore each lab folder for step by step instructions and scripts.
2. Refer to screenshots, diagrams, and notes for context.

## Learning Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with IaC.
- Learn best practices for an IaC approach.
- Document progress and maintain a reference for troubleshooting and improvement.
- Build a portfolio that demonstrates practical Infrastructure as Code skills.

## Progress Tracker

- [X] Terraform: Provision VM single-node on premises
- [X] Terraform: Provision Multi-node cluster on premises
- [ ] Terraform: Provision EC2 instance on AWS

## Notes and Future Improvement

- Continuously update labs as skills grow.
- Add more advanced mini-projects of IaC.
- Keep track of learning paths for exam certifications.
