# Terraform

Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you build, change, and version cloud and on-prem resources safely and efficiently. Instead of manually creating and configuring resources, you write declarative configuration files that describe the desired state of your infrastructure.

## Why Terraform?

- `Declarative syntax`: Define the desired infrastructure state without worrying about the underlying steps.
- `Idempotency`: Running the same configuration multiple times produces the same results.
- `Execution plans`: Preview the changes Terraform will make before applying them.
- `State management`: Keep track of resources it manages, enabling incremental changes and drift detection.
- `Extensibility`: Wide support for providers and modules, allowing you to build reusable infrastructure code.
